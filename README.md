# Titanic Survival Predictor

## Project Overview

This project employs advanced machine learning methodologies to construct a predictive model capable of determining the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the Titanic. By leveraging critical features such as passenger demographics, socioeconomic status, and travel class, the model achieves a commendable predictive accuracy of **83%** on the validation dataset.

## Features

- **Input Variables**: A set of attributes encompassing age, gender, fare, passenger class, and other pertinent factors.
- **Output Variable**: A binary classification predicting whether a passenger "Survived" or "Did Not Survive."
- **Model Performance**: An accuracy rate of 83%, indicative of robust classification efficacy.

## Technologies and Libraries Utilized

- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing and modeling.
- **pandas**: Facilitates sophisticated data manipulation and preprocessing operations.
- **numpy**: Enables efficient numerical computations.
- **scikit-learn**: Comprehensive suite of machine learning tools:
  - **LabelEncoder**: Facilitates transformation of categorical data into numerical format.
  - **StandardScaler**: Standardizes feature distributions for optimal model performance.
  - **SimpleImputer**: Addresses and imputes missing data values effectively.
  - **RandomForestClassifier**: Implements ensemble learning for robust classification.
  - **train_test_split**: Divides data into training and testing subsets for model validation.

## Methodological Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Address missing data using `SimpleImputer`.
   - Encode categorical variables with `LabelEncoder` to ensure compatibility with numerical models.
   - Standardize numerical features utilizing `StandardScaler` to eliminate scale variances.

2. **Data Partitioning**:
   - Employ `train_test_split` to create distinct training and validation datasets.

3. **Model Construction**:
   - Train a `RandomForestClassifier`, leveraging its ensemble approach to optimize predictive performance.

4. **Model Assessment**:
   - Quantitatively evaluate the classifier using performance metrics derived from the validation dataset.
